afplay command interface of python

```
python play.py michael
> Playing 'Michael Jackson Song.mp3'
```

Macaron enable you to play BGM while coding without moving your hand from terminal.
You can just use afplay command, but you merely remember the exact directory and file name of the song you like.
Macaron creates instant playlist for example,

```
python play.py micheal
```

Will create a playlist (may be) of Micheal Jackson. Current version is capable of finding a song by matching...

- the part of the file name (ex. 'michael' matches 'michael_jackson.mp3')
- upper case name by either upper case of lower case name (ex. 'Michael Jackson.mp3' can be found either by 'Michael' or 'michael'

but unintentionally...

- 'michael' matches 'michael douglas.mp3'
